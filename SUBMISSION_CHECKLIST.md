## Final Steps Before Submission

### 1. Test Everything

```bash
# Test backend
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest

# Test frontend (in new terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 2. Verify the Application Works

- [ ] Backend starts without errors on http://localhost:8000
- [ ] Frontend starts without errors on http://localhost:5173
- [ ] Can create, update, and delete drivers

- [ ] Date filtering works on assignments page

### 3. Review Documentation

- [ ] README.md is clear and complete
- [ ] SETUP_GUIDE.md has accurate instructions
- [ ] All code comments are in English
- [ ] No TODO comments left in production code

### 4. Check Git Repository

```bash
# View commit history
git log --oneline

# Check for any uncommitted changes
git status

# Ensure no sensitive files are tracked
git ls-files | grep -E "\\.env$|credentials|secrets"
```

### 5. Create Submission Package

#### Option A: ZIP File

```bash
# From project root
cd ..
zip -r loadsmart-submission.zip loadsmart/ -x "*/node_modules/*" "*/venv/*" "*/.git/*" "*/__pycache__/*" "*.pyc" "*/.pytest_cache/*" "*/dist/*"
```

#### Option B: Private GitHub Repository

```bash
# Create a new private repository on GitHub
# Then push your code:
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 6. Email Submission

**To:** tech-hiring@loadsmart.com

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- [ ] Don't include `node_modules/` or `venv/` in submission
- [ ] Don't include `.env` files with actual credentials
- [ ] Don't make repository public (per instructions)
- [ ] Don't include compiled files (`__pycache__`, `dist/`, etc.)
- [ ] Don't leave debugging code or console.logs
- [ ] Don't use generic commit messages like "fix" or "update"
- [ ] Don't reference AI tools in commits or code

## Estimated Time to Complete

- Backend implementation: ~4-6 hours
- Frontend implementation: ~3-4 hours
- Testing: ~2-3 hours
- Documentation: ~1-2 hours
- **Total: ~10-15 hours for junior engineer**
